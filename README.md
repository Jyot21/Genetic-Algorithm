# Genetic Algorithm
This is python implementation of The Genetic algorithm with an example of simple dot program.
 ## Objective:
   We need the population of dots trained such as they find shortest, simplest distance from the origin point to the target.
### This is only python implementation of algorithm originally written by Code-Bullet in javascript.
### I took some freedom in selecting library for animating dots(I have used matplotlib animation for this) and basic structure of code is same like class, using physics principles and genetic algorithm varient.
